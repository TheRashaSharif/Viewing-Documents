We are still in our Realitivty one workspace.

Project 2: Viewing Documents

Objectives: 
-Accessing the case workspace.
- Becoming familiar with the case workspace interface.
- Accessing the core Relativity viewer. 
- Getting back to the Relativity workspace.

Environment: 
- Browser (Firefox).
- Relativity online tool.
- Training credentials.
 
 In this case, we will view the case workspace from the system administrator and the viewer.
 
 In the same training Relativity workspace, there is a huge space that is usually for listing workspaces. We can click on a workspace clickable link to open the case workspace. Example: clicking on the Salt vs.Pepper case ( first case in the list).

The next window will be the documents tab on the left side, it has all the documents in the workspace listed.

Case workspace components are:
- Browser ( to the left).
- Search panel ( to lower left).
- Items list ( to the right) 
- View bar ( top/upper bar).
- Search bar ( top/lower bar)

The system admin has access to all workspaces. ( like the previous view).
The next view is an example of a viewer view that has fewer cases and tabs than an admin.

After we saw the different views, remember the security features for viewers can be customized. 

To open a document, we can click on the clickable link in the list, for example, the first document in the case workspace.
This example is a Word document that will open in the document viewer, which is also called the core of Relativity:

To go back to the document workspace, we can click on the exit viewer button in the upper left corner.
To get back to the workspace, we can click on the tool name ( One) in this case. Which is located in the upper left corner.

That was our project for today!
See you in the next one.
